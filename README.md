# BuckForBiz üöÄ

Hey there! We're two friends with a big goal: to start our own business. But we need your help. We're asking for just $1 from each person. It's amazing how even a dollar can help us get closer to our dream.

## Our Dream ‚ú®

We've got a dream, and you're a big part of it. We're collecting $1 donations to kick things off. And we want you to decide the business! Check out our [pineed post](linktopost.instagram) on Instagram, and drop your business idea there. The idea with the most likes is the one we'll work on making a reality.

1. **Donate $1**: Every single dollar brings us a step closer.
2. **Share Ideas**: Go to our Instagram pinned post. Comment with your business idea.
3. **Like Ideas**: Like your favorite ideas on that post. The top one wins.
4. **Watch Us Grow**: We're posting a video every day to show how much we've raised.

## Donate üí∏

Just $1 can make a difference. Here's how you can send it:
